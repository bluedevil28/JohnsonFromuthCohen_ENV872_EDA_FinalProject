## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r setup}
getwd()
SmartLocationDataset <- 
  read.csv("Smart_Location_Database_County_FIPS_Code_003.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

PittsburghSmartLocationDataset <- 
  filter(SmartLocationDataset, CBSA_Name == "Pittsburgh, PA")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
